msgid "HT-M00 is a small, low-cost dual-channel LoRa gateway, Use Type-C interface. The HT-M00 gateway drives two SX1276 chips based on ESP32. We have written a software mixer (baseband simulation program) to monitor the spreading factor of 125KHz SF7~SF12. The main function of HT-M00 is to provide LoRaWAN network for large houses of 1500~2000 square meters, or to make up for the blind spots of the signal in the area that the SX1301 gateway signal cannot cover."
