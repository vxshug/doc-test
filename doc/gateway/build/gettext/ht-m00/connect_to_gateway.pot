msgid "This article aims to describe how to connect nodes to HT-M00 Gateway, which facilitates secondary development and rapid deployment of LoRa devices. HT-M00 is a dual-channel gateway. To ensure good communication between the node and the gateway, the channel used by the node must correspond to that of the HT-M00 gateway. This document takes CN470 as an example."

Converting hexadecimal FF to binary is 11111111. The 11111111 from low bits to high bits correspond to the first 0-7 channels, that is, the last 1 corresponds to channel 0, and the first 1 corresponds to channel 7. When you modify \"userChannelsMask[0]=0x0001\", it means that the channel is changed to 0, which is 470.3MHz, When you modify \"userChannelsMask[0]=0x0080\", it means that the channel is changed to 7, which is 471.7MHz, When you modify \"userChannelsMask[0]=0xFF00\", it means that the channels are changed to 8-15, which are 471.9MHz, 472.1MHz, 472.3MHz...473.3MHz."
